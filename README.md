# Problem Statement

To unlock Sales Insights that are not visible before for sales team for decision support & automate them to reduced time spend in data gathering.

# Solution

The dataset is available in MySql 

And I have connected to MySql with the tableau connector as to keep updated the dashboards.

I have made Dashboards named -Revenue Analysis

The Insights contains -

* Revenue by Markets

* Sales Quantity by Markets

* Profit Margin by Markets

* Profit trend by Year

* Revenue by Year

* Top 5 Customers by Profit and Revenue

* Top 5 Products by Profit and Revenue

# Recommendation

Based on the dashbaords insights, I have made some recommendation that Sales Marketing team should/can -

1. consider making a sales strategy for especially lucknow since its showing lowest revenue and negative profit margin and if possible so as for Surat and Bhubhaneshwar also.

2. try to increase its sales quantity in Patna, Surat and Kanpur since they have lowest sales quantity.

3. start their target campagin for Prod047 and Prod061 since they two are the most profitable and most selling products.

4. try to give special benefits to Electronics and _Excel store_s as they are their most profitable customers.

5. make their campgain strategy for mid year as they are showing high sales among other months.
